                    ballet
                    together with a healthly medical history. All professional students are required to take an ISTD

                    international
                    competitions. It is essential that students and parents are fully committed to the teaching and
                    guidance of the program in order to maintain its integrity.

                <p><strong>Foundation Training</strong>
                    The Foundation Training Program is for the amateur/part-time dancer aged 7-12yrs who loves to dance
                    and
                    wants to work on poise, posture, and discipline together with technique, musicality, and artistry.
                    A
                    minimum of twice a week is required and students (if ready) are encouraged to enter an ISTD ballet

                <p><strong>ISTD Imperial Classical Ballet</strong>
                    The roots of Imperial Classical Ballet stem from the early days of the ISTD and the first written
                    syllabus in 1913 which was based on the teaching of the French School from the Paris Opéra. The
                    syllabus has now evolved to promote the English classical style and addresses the changing needs of
                    Ballet dancers today. Students in both the Professional and Foundation training programs are
                    encouraged
                    to take an examination once a year.
                    ISTD Graded & Vocational exams are recognized internationally and acknowledged by the BC Ministry
                    of
                    Education, with Vocational certification awarding school credits.

                    age
                    appropriate creativity, musicality, and physicality. Children gain confidence, poise, and a solid
                    frame
                    work on which to build classical ballet technique.
                    The program offers boys and girls the opportunity to present informal in-house performances for
                    their
                    parents each term.
